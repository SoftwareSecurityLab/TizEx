# TizenSecurity
TizenSecurity is a project by which Tizen native and web applications can be analyzed for security vulnerabilities. In analyzing each type of application, certain tools and techniques are utilized. However, the basis for all of these techniques remains the same, that is dynamic symbolic analysis.

Web application analysis mainly focuses on XSS and HTML injection while Native application analysis mainly focuses on buffer overflow.

#### For further reading about each type of application analysis, you can explore its related directory in this repository. There is a README file in each one, describing in more details, about how to run the programs.
